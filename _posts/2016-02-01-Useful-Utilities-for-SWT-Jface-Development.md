## Overview
Even though Eclipse 4 RCP Development is pretty interesting, but the User Interfaces development using SWT/JFace is pretty difficult if you are not accustomed to **WindowBuilder**. But still I prefer developing User Interfaces by writing code. Aren't we developers? We are supposed to write code, right? ;)

Here, I have a list of utility tools that would help Eclipse RCP Developers to build User Interfaces efficiently.
