## Short Bio

I am a professional Java Developer with 3.5 years of experience. I had completed my Bachelor from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India in 2012 and currently pursuing my Master's degree in Technical University of Munich, Germany. I have intensive experiences in enterprise Internet of Things related projects, in Modular Application Development using OSGi and in Eclipse Frameworks (Eclipse RCP, Eclipse Kura, EMF, Equinox).

I am also a passionate Java Developer and an Enthusiast. Itâ€™s my passion to work with my mac all day long, garnering knowledge from heterogenous sources, fiddling around with cool things in Java. That's why, here I would love to enumerate Java-related miscellaneous articles and remnants to demonstrate the versatility of Java.

I hope you would love them.
