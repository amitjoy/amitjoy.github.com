## Short Bio

This is Amit Kumar Mondal and I’m a 2012 Bachelor of Technology graduate from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur (NIT Durgapur) in IT and currently studying Master’s Computer Science at Technical University of Munich, Germany. This is my personal blog where I am interested to array several java related stuffs which might be of your interest.

It’s my passion to work with my mac all day long, garnering knowledge from heterogenous sources. Here I would love to enumerate Java-related stuffs to showcase the versatility of Java.
